## Project Status

This project is currently pre-production and could change without much notice, however we are looking for community feedback so please try out our code or give us feedback!

## Deployment

You can download [our docker image `moov/paygate`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/paygate/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8082` and metrics at `:9092/metrics` in Prometheus format.

Also, `go run` works:

```
$ cd moov/paygate # wherever this project lives

$ go run .
ts=2018-12-13T19:18:11.970293Z caller=main.go:55 startup="Starting paygate server version v0.1.0-rc3"
ts=2018-12-13T19:18:11.970391Z caller=main.go:59 main="sqlite version 3.25.2"

```

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moov-io/ach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started!

Note: This project uses Go Modules, which requires Go 1.11 or higher, but we ship the vendor directory in our repository.

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).

Tests can run processes (like sqlite databases), but should only do so locally.

Each PR should increase the overall coverage, if possible. You can run `make cover-test` to save a coverage profile and `make cover-web` to open the HTML view in your default browser.
