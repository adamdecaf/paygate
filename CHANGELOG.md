## v0.8.0 (Unreleased)

Version v0.8.0 of PayGate adds some Prometheus metrics, basic transfer limits, and an OpenAPI specification for admin endpoints. Along with internal refactoring to cleanup code we have removed the `Depository` account number migration from previous releases.

`Transfer` objects have an additional status called `reviewable` which prevents them from being uploaded to an ODFI and requires their manual approval with admin endpoints.

ADDITIONS

- admin: Include generated Go client code and OpenAPI specification
- filetransfer: add ach_file_upload_errors for tracking ACH upload errors
- transfers: introduce basic calculations for N-day transfer limits
- transfers: store the client's real ip address on creation
- transfers: set status to 'reviewable' if over the limit
- transfers: add admin route for selective transfer status updates
- filetransfer: remove micro-deposits from mergable file when the Depository is deleted
- filetransfer: add admin endpoint for merging outgoing files

IMPROVEMENTS

- filetransfer: disable `Depository` field updates from NOC's, allow via config (`UPDATE_DEPOSITORIES_FROM_CHANGE_CODE=yes`)
- filetransfer: reject related objects from COR/NOC when not auto-updating fields
- filetransfer: rename admin HTTP routes to /configs/filetransfers/*
- api: use shared Error model
- api,client: clarify Address and BirthDate for KYC is not persisted
- verification/microdeposit: move routes, repository, etc into subpackage
- filetransfer: remove batches when deleting non-uploaded transfer
- transfers: refactor Receiver status check back into transfers package

BUG FIXES

- admin: fix micro-deposit return unmarshal
- filetransfer: fix partial updating of FileTransferConfig in admin HTTP routes
- filetransfer: handle nil FTPTransferAgent in Close
- depository: in admin update status route read userID from path
- originators,receivers: return null BirthDate,Address if empty
- filetransfer,transfers: update status once Transfers are merged, not in MarkTransferAsMerged
- transfers: fix amount storage truncation

## v0.7.0 (Released 2020-01-15)

Version v0.7.0 of Paygate adds more support for return and incoming (COR/NOC) file processing along with admin methods for updating file transfer configuration without needing to restart paygate or update the underlying database directly.

Account numbers are encrypted in a migration as part of this release. Masked versions are stored alongside their encrypted form, but the cleartext values are not wiped.

Please [read over the guide for account number encryption migration](docs/account-number-encryption.md#encrypted-account-numbers).

Also included are [filename templates](https://docs.moov.io/paygate/ach/#filename-templates) for merged ACH files uploaded to an ODFI. This allows banks with specific rules for files to be used with paygate.

KYC information is now optionally read for `Originator` and `Receiver` objects on creation. Paygate uses Moov Customers to perform validation and an OFAC check of this data.

The Moov Customers service will be used to register each Originator and Receiver (and their Depository) objects with any disclaimers required to be accepted prior to Transfer creation. OFAC searches for each customer are refreshed weekly by default with a config option to change the allowed staleness.

ADDITIONS

- internal/filetransfer: add HTTP routes for updating and deleting file transfer configs
- internal/filetransfer: allow synchronous waiting for flush routes (`/files/flush?wait`)
- main: Add 'GET /version' admin endpoint
- api,client: add return codes to Depository and Transfer HTTP responses
- filetransfer: support reading a config file for routing and FTP/SFTP configuration

- depositories: add admin route for overriding status
- micro-deposits: record metrics on initate and confirmation
- micro-deposits: prevent additional attempts once we've failed too many times
- customers: Refresh OFAC searches weekly by default
- filetransfer: reject file uploads if they're not whitelisted by IP address

IMPROVEMENTS

- micro-deposits: don't require x-user-id on admin route to read
- internal/filetransfer: override String() on ftp and sftp configs to hide passwords
- micro-deposits: debit the micro-deposit from the remote account when crediting
- micro-deposits: accumulate deposit amounts for a final withdraw
- files: reverse micro-deposit transactions in Accounts, if enabled

## v0.6.0 (Released 2019-08-19)

Version v0.6.0 of Paygate is the largest change so far in Paygate's history. This release contains changes to support multiple ACH file upload protocols (SFTP - SSH file transfers), a more responsive local development setup, secure and validated TLS connections between paygate and all of its dependencies, versioned database migrations, and several other improvements.

Also included in this release are several admin endpoints (those bound on the `:9092` HTTP server). HTTP endpoints for reading micro-deposits made against a depository (intended for customer service and integration testing), manually initiating the merging of Transfers into files for upload to their origin/ODFI, and to read ACH file upload configs (FTP, SFTP, paths, etc..).

BREAKING CHANGES

- `sftp_configs` has been renamed to `ftp_configs` as it was incorrectly named before.
  - A new table called `sftp_configs` has been created for SSH File Transfers
  - Users need to copy data and delete the table so paygate can re-create `sftp_configs` for its new purpose.

ADDITIONS

- main: bind HTTP server with TLS if HTTPS_* variables are defined
- files: support `ACH_FILE_TRANSFER_INTERVAL=off` to disable async file operations
- http: setup http.Client's with additional root certificates
- main: override -log.format with LOG_FORMAT and -http.addr with HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS

- internal/filetransfer: add HTTP endpoints for reading SFTP configs
- internal/filetransfer: sftp: override HostKeyCallback if provided in config
- internal/filetransfer: provide env variables for FTP and SFTP connections (e.g. timeouts, concurrency)
- internal/database: use lopezator/migrator for versioned database migrations
- internal/filetransfer: sftp: read base64 encoded public/private keys
- files: read ACH_FILE_MAX_LINES to override NACHA 10k line default
- internal/filetransfer: add DEV_FILE_TRANSFER_TYPE for local dev
- internal/filetransfer: sftp: create remote outbound dir and upload into it
- files: setup a channel for manually merge and uploading of Transfers
- micro-deposits: add to ACH files for upload to the Federal Reserve

- common: return strconv.Atoi's error when parsing whole dollar amount
- files: upload ACH files to their origin, not destination
- internal/filetransfer: sftp: fix nil panic in readFiles

IMPROVEMENTS
