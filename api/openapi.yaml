    PayGate is a RESTful API enabling first-party Automated Clearing House ([ACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House)) transfers to be created without a deep understanding of a full NACHA file specification. First-party transfers initiate at an Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) and are sent off to other Financial Institutions.

    Tenants are the largest grouping in PayGate and are typically a vendor who is reselling ACH services or a company making ACH payments themselves. A legal entity is linked off a Tenant as the primary Customer used to KYC and in transfers with the Tenant itself.

    An Organization is a grouping within a Tenant which typically represents an entity making ACH transfers. These include clients of an ACH reseller or business accepting payments over ACH. A legal entity is linked off an Organization as the primary Customer used to KYC and in transfers with the Organization itself.

    There are also [admin endpoints](https://moov-io.github.io/paygate/admin/) for back-office operations.
